# GeulPan42TP Keyboard

If you can't drag while using the trackpoint, please use "PS2_MOUSE_USE_REMOTE_MODE". 

However, for parts where the trackpoint is not connected, you should use "Stream Mode".

"PS/2 mouse" was not connected, using "remote mode" caused the controller to malfunction.

example : Master Side use "PS2_MOUSE_USE_REMOTE_MODE", Slave Side use "Stream Mode"

If the cursor malfunctions when using "remote mode", please reconnect the keyboard.

As a temporary solution to this problem, I have enabled the option to solder GP28 and GP29.
If you solder GP28 and GP29, you will be able to assign and use QMK mouse buttons.
